      <description>Aim: The aim of this project was to understand and evaluate the different interpolation schemes. For the purpose of this project, we implemented 4 interpolation schemes, namely:
 • Linear interpolation using Euler angles • Bezier interpolation using Euler angles • Spherical Linear interpolation using quaternions • Spherical Bezier interpolation using quaternions  Procedure: Step 1 :
To start with, we were given a bunch of (ASF + AMC) files corresponding to different motion capture sequences.</description>

      <title>Pose transfer of an Armadillo using eigen functions</title>

      <description>Aim:  The aim of this project is to understand the role of eigenfunctions in pose estimation  Background: What are Eigenfunctions and why we are using them ?
Now that we understand the value of eigenfunctions and their usage. Let’s see how these can be applied to mesh deformation.
Procedure: Consider 2 poses that you would like to do the pose transfer between. Let us consider Pose-A as the source mesh and Pose-B as the destination mesh.</description>

      <title>Simulating a Constrained Particle System</title>

      <description>Aim: The aim of the project was to use a particle system to model a simple deformable chain that moves along a ring and obeys :
 Newtons Laws Geometric Constraints  Background : For this system, we define three constraints, namely :
 Rigid Edge Constraint : This helps to keep the objects fixed in position and rotation relative to each other. Pin Constraint : This helps to prevent the chain from falling away under gravity.</description>

      <title>Simulating a Jello cube</title>

      <description>Aim: The aim of this project was to understand the application of 3D mass-spring network in physically based modelling. To achieve this, we programmed a physically-based simulation of a jello cube which was modelled using a 3D mass spring network. The jello cube was modelled to be made of elastic material, i.e., when the jello cube is stretched, it will try to contract and when the jello cube is squeezed, it will try to inflate back to the original shape.</description>

      <title>Simulating a Roller Coaster using Splines</title>
      <link>https://vathsal.github.io/myWebsite/works/project-2/</link>

      <description>Aim : Having been introduced to splines and OpenGL programming, the aim of this project was to understand the application of splines. For this, we modelled a roller coaster using Catmull-Rom splines and then simulated a first person view of a person riding the roller coaster in an immersive environment using OpenGL lighting and texture mapping.
Background : Why choose catmul rom splines ?
Catmull-Rom splines are a family of cubic interpolating splines such that the tangent at each point is calculated using the next and the previous position on the spline.</description>
